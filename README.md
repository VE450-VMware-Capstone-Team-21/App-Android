# AR Based on Sceneform

Using the Sceneform, we are able to put the ViewRenderable object to display text in AR. However, unfortunately, Sceneform is archived, and does not support AndriodX, which conflicts with ML Kit.

Update: migrate to AndriodX seems to solve this problem. I might have been misleaded by the issue on Github.
